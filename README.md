# Kelora

[![CI](https://github.com/dloss/kelora/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/dloss/kelora/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/kelora.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/kelora) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-kelora.dev-blue)](https://kelora.dev)

**Turn messy logs into structured data.**

Kelora is a scriptable log processor for the command line. Parse structured or semi-structured logs (one format per file/stream), filter with complex logic, and analyze streams using embedded [Rhai](https://rhai.rs) scripting with 150+ built-in functions. Handles JSON, logfmt, syslog, CSV/TSV, gzip, with sequential or `--parallel` execution and built-in metrics. Can also extract logfmt/JSON blobs embedded inside a single event.

## Quick Example

```bash
kelora examples/quickstart.log -f 'cols:ts(3) level *msg' -l error -e 'e.absorb_kv("msg")' --normalize-ts -J
```

**Input (unstructured logs with embedded key=value pairs):**
```
Jan 15 10:00:15 ERROR Payment timeout order=1234 gateway=stripe duration=5s
Jan 15 10:00:22 ERROR Gateway unreachable host=stripe.com
Jan 15 10:00:28 ERROR Authentication failed user=admin ip=192.168.1.50 reason=invalid_token
```

**Output (structured JSON with extracted fields):**
```json
{"ts":"2025-01-15T10:00:15+00:00","level":"ERROR","msg":"Payment timeout","order":"1234","gateway":"stripe","duration":"5s"}
{"ts":"2025-01-15T10:00:22+00:00","level":"ERROR","msg":"Gateway unreachable","host":"stripe.com"}
{"ts":"2025-01-15T10:00:28+00:00","level":"ERROR","msg":"Authentication failed","user":"admin","ip":"192.168.1.50","reason":"invalid_token"}
```

Kelora also handles live streams: `tail -f app.log | kelora -j -l error,warn`.

## When to Use Kelora

Kelora trades speed for programmability—slower than grep/awk/jq, but adds stateful scripting for complex transformations. Use it when your logs are **messy** (stick to one format per file/stream, but pull out embedded JSON/logfmt fields), need **stateful logic** (counters, windowed metrics, lookup tables), or are **chaining multiple tools**. For simple text search use `grep`, for JSON queries use `jq`.

## Installation

Download from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dloss/kelora/releases)** (macOS, Linux, Windows) or:

```bash
cargo install kelora
```

## Stability Promise (1.0+)

Starting with v1.0, Kelora follows semantic versioning:
- **CLI flags, Rhai functions, exit codes**: Stable. Breaking changes only in major versions (2.0, 3.0, etc.)
- **Deprecations**: Marked for one minor version before removal

## Development Status

Tool generated entirely by AI agents. Validated by a large test suite and Rust security tools, but **inspect the code before production use**. See the [Security Policy](https://github.com/dloss/kelora/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

This is a spare-time solo project—responses and updates happen on a best-effort basis.
