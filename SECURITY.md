# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Kelora, please report it privately:

- **Email:** security@dirk-loss.de
- **Subject line:** "Kelora Security: [brief description]"
- **Include:** Version number, description of the issue, and steps to reproduce

**Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### What to Expect

Kelora is maintained by a single developer on a best-effort basis. Security reports are taken seriously, but response times reflect this reality:

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 1 week
- **Assessment:** Within 2-4 weeks depending on complexity
- **Resolution:** Timelines depend on severity and complexity; critical issues will be prioritized
- **Disclosure:** After a fix is released, the vulnerability will be documented in the changelog

For critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate action, please clearly mark them as such in your report.

## Supported Versions

Kelora is currently in active development. Security updates are provided for the latest release only.

As a 0.x release, Kelora does not guarantee backports to older versions. Users should stay up to date with the latest release.

## Security Measures

Kelora implements multiple layers of security controls to ensure safe operation:

### Automated Testing

- **770+ test functions** covering core functionality, parsers, and edge cases
- **Integration tests** validating end-to-end behavior
- **CI enforcement** on every commit (formatting, linting, tests)

### Dependency Security

- **cargo-audit** runs via `just audit` to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **cargo-deny** enforces dependency policies via `just deny`:
  - License compliance (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, etc.)
  - Advisory checking against RustSec database
  - Duplicate dependency detection
  - Source verification (crates.io only)

### Code Safety

- **Minimal unsafe code:** Only 2 `unsafe` blocks in the entire codebase (all other unsafe code is forbidden)
  - `src/decompression.rs` - Manual `Send` implementation for `DecompressionReader` (all variants contain `Send` types)
  - `src/readers.rs` - Manual `Send` implementation for `PeekableLineReader` (underlying reader is `Send`)
- **Clippy enforcement** with warnings-as-errors (`-D warnings`) blocks any lints from merging
- **Memory safety:** Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free, and data races

### Development Process

Kelora is developed using AI-generated code (Claude, GPT-5). Validated through automated testing, not manual review. Quality assurance includes:
- Comprehensive automated tests for all features
- Functional validation through testing and usage
- Continuous integration checks on every change
- Security tooling (audit, deny) integrated into development workflow

### CI/CD Pipeline

Every commit and pull request must pass:
- `cargo fmt --all --check` (code formatting)
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (static analysis)
- `cargo test --all-features` (all tests must pass)

## Known Security Advisories

Kelora currently ignores one advisory in `deny.toml`:

- **RUSTSEC-2024-0384** - `instant` crate is unmaintained
  - **Reason:** Transitive dependency via `chrono`, acceptable risk for now
  - **Mitigation:** Monitoring for upstream fixes or alternatives
  - **Impact:** No known exploits affecting Kelora's use case

All other advisories result in build failures.

## Threat Model

### What Kelora Does

- Processes log files locally on your machine
- Executes user-provided Rhai scripts against log data
- Reads from files, stdin, and gzip/zstd compressed streams
- Writes to stdout or files

### What Kelora Does NOT Do

- No network access (no outbound connections)
- No privilege escalation
- No persistent daemons or background processes
- No telemetry or data collection
- No modification of input files (read-only)

### Security Boundaries

**Trusted inputs:**
- Rhai scripts provided by the user (via `--exec`, `--filter`, `-E`)
- Configuration files (`.kelora.ini`, aliases)

**Untrusted inputs:**
- Log file contents (may contain attacker-controlled data)
- Standard input streams

**Protections:**
- Log data is parsed and processed but cannot execute code
- Rhai scripts run in a sandboxed environment with no filesystem write access by default
  - File writes require explicit `--allow-fs-write` flag (enables `append_file()` function)
  - Standard output redirection (`>`, `>>`) is controlled by the shell, not Kelora
- Malformed log entries are skipped with diagnostics (default resilient mode)

### Known Limitations

1. **Rhai script safety:** User-provided scripts execute with the same privileges as the Kelora process. Users should review scripts from untrusted sources.

2. **Resource exhaustion:** Processing very large files or complex scripts can consume significant CPU and memory. Use `--parallel` for large archives and monitor resource usage.

3. **Regex complexity:** User-provided regex patterns in scripts could be computationally expensive on crafted input. The regex engine (Rust `regex` crate) has DoS protections, but extremely complex patterns may still be slow.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Running Kelora Safely

1. **Review scripts before execution:** If using scripts from external sources, review them first
2. **Use `--strict` mode cautiously:** Strict mode fails on parse errors; default resilient mode is safer for production
3. **Limit resource usage:** Use `ulimit` or containerization when processing untrusted files
4. **Keep Kelora updated:** Security fixes are only applied to the latest version
5. **Validate file sources:** Only process log files from trusted sources when handling sensitive data

### Example: Safe Processing of Untrusted Logs

```bash
# Process with resource limits (Linux/macOS)
ulimit -v 2000000  # 2GB virtual memory limit

# With timeout (Linux with GNU coreutils)
timeout 60s kelora -j untrusted.jsonl --filter 'e.level == "ERROR"'

# Or use shell job control (cross-platform)
kelora -j untrusted.jsonl --filter 'e.level == "ERROR"' &
PID=$!
sleep 60 && kill $PID 2>/dev/null

# Use strict mode to fail fast on malformed input
kelora -j logs.jsonl --strict --filter 'e.valid_field'
```

## Dependency Policy

Kelora only uses dependencies from crates.io with the following criteria:

- **License:** Must be compatible with MIT and not impose additional restrictions (no copyleft licenses like GPL)
  - Allowed: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Zlib, Unlicense, CC0-1.0, MPL-2.0, Unicode-3.0, BSL-1.0
- **Source:** Must come from crates.io (no git dependencies)
- **Maintenance:** Prefer actively maintained crates
- **Security:** No known high-severity vulnerabilities (enforced by cargo-audit)
- **Scope:** Only well-established crates for critical functions (parsing, crypto, compression)

See `deny.toml` for the complete dependency policy configuration and enforcement rules.

## Security Audit History

No formal third-party security audits have been conducted. The project relies on:
- Automated tooling (cargo-audit, cargo-deny, clippy)
- Rust's memory safety guarantees
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Community review (open source)
