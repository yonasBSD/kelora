# Script Variables Reference

Kelora exposes several built-in variables to Rhai scripts. Their availability depends on which stage is executing (per-event filters/execs, span hooks, begin/end hooks, etc.). Use this page whenever you need to know which data is in scope.

## Stage Overview

| Stage / Feature | Variables Available | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| `--filter`, `--exec`, `--exec-file` | `line`, `e`, `meta`, `conf`, `state` | Per-event context. `e` and `state` are writable; the others are read-only. `state` only in sequential mode. |
| `--filter` / `--exec` with `--window` | `line`, `e`, `meta`, `conf`, `state`, `window` | Adds the sliding `window` array (current event at index `0`; read-only). `state` only in sequential mode. |
| `--begin` | `conf`, `state` | Map to seed configuration before events arrive. `conf` is read-only; `state` is writable (sequential mode only). |
| `--end` | `metrics`, `conf`, `state` | Inspect final tracker totals in `metrics` and final `state`; `conf` and `metrics` are read-only. `state` only in sequential mode. |
| `--span-close` | `span`, `metrics`, `conf` | Summarises the closed span with per-span data (`span`) and cumulative totals (`metrics`). All read-only. |

> Reading a variable that does not exist in the current stage raises a Rhai error. Variables listed here are populated with meaningful data (individual fields inside maps may still be `()`). Other globals such as `line`/`e` exist behind the scenes for compatibility but start empty in stages where they are not useful.

## Common Variables

### `line`
- Type: `String`
- Snapshot of the text the parser captured for the current record. Structured formats strip trailing newlines before storing it, `-f raw` preserves every byte (including terminators), and `--multiline` reflects the chunk assembled by the multiline stage. Present in every stage and read-only.
- You’ll also see the same text at `meta.line`; that copy travels with saved metadata (window snapshots, span hooks, cloned `meta` values) so the original record is still available later on.

### `e`
- Type: `Map`
- Event map during per-event stages. Mutating `e` inside `--exec` updates the emitted event; setting a field to `()` removes it; assigning `e = ()` clears the entire event. Writable.

### `meta`
- Type: `Map`
- Metadata derived from the pipeline and span system. Attempting to mutate `meta` fields has no effect; use event fields on `e` for custom annotations instead. Read-only.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `line` | `String` | Same as the standalone `line` variable. |
| `line_num` | `Int` | 1-based line number when input comes from files. |
| `filename` | `String` | Source filename, if known. |
| `parsed_ts` | `DateTime` or `()` | Parsed UTC timestamp before any `--filter`/`--exec` scripts. Missing if the event had no timestamp. |
| `span_status` | `String` | `"included"`, `"late"`, `"unassigned"`, or `"filtered"` when spans are enabled. Missing otherwise. |
| `span_id` | `String` or `()` | Span identifier for the current event. |
| `span_start` / `span_end` | `DateTime` or `()` | Span bounds for the current event. |

### `conf`
- Type: `Map`
- Configuration produced by `--begin` and CLI options; the map is frozen so mutation attempts are ignored. Read-only.

### `state`
- Type: `StateMap` (special wrapper, not a regular `Map`)
- Mutable global map for complex state tracking across events. Available in all per-event stages (`--filter`, `--exec`, `--begin`, `--end`) **in sequential mode only**.

#### Mental Model

Think of `state` as a **persistent notebook** that travels with your log processor:

- Each event can READ from and WRITE to this notebook
- Previous events can leave notes for future events
- The notebook persists across all files in a single run
- When processing ends, the notebook is discarded

This differs from `track_*()` functions, which are **write-only counters** that accumulate metrics but can't influence per-event decisions.

#### When to Use

**Use `state` for:**

- Deduplication (tracking seen IDs)
- Cross-event dependencies and correlation
- Storing complex objects (nested maps, arrays)
- Conditional logic based on previous events
- State machines and session reconstruction

**Don't use `state` for:**

- Simple counting or metrics → use `track_count()`, `track_sum()`, etc.
  - These work in parallel mode too
  - More efficient (atomic operations vs RwLock)

**Comparison with `track_*()`:**

| Feature | `state` | `track_*()` |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Complex stateful logic | Simple metrics & aggregations |
| **Read access** | ✅ Yes (during processing) | ❌ No (write-only, read in `--end`) |
| **Parallel mode** | ❌ Sequential only | ✅ Works in parallel |
| **Storage** | Any Rhai value | Any value (strings, numbers, etc.) |
| **Performance** | Slower (RwLock) | Faster (atomic/optimized) |
| **Use for** | Deduplication, FSMs, correlation | Counting, unique tracking, bucketing |

#### State Lifecycle

State persists:

- ✅ Across multiple input files in one invocation
- ✅ From `--begin` through all events to `--end`
- ✅ Between events within the same run

State resets:

- ❌ Between separate `kelora` invocations (no persistence to disk)
- ❌ When using `state.clear()` explicitly
- ❌ Not per-file or per-batch (common misconception)

Example: Processing 3 files maintains one shared state:
```bash
# State persists across all 3 files
kelora -j file1.json file2.json file3.json \
  --exec 'state[e.user] = true'  # Deduplicates across ALL files
```

#### Operations

**Direct operations** (no conversion needed):

- Indexing: `state["key"]` for get/set, returns `()` if key doesn't exist
- Methods: `contains(key)`, `get(key)`, `set(key, value)`, `len()`, `is_empty()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `clear()`, `remove(key)`
- Operators: `+=`, `mixin(map)`, `fill_with(map)`

**For other map functions**: Convert to regular map first using `state.to_map()`, then use any map function:
```rhai
// Convert state to use functions like to_logfmt(), to_kv(), etc.
print(state.to_map().to_logfmt());
let json_str = state.to_map().to_json();
```

#### Performance Considerations

**Memory usage**: State grows with unique keys. For deduplication of millions of IDs, consider:

```rhai
// Periodic cleanup
if state.len() > 100000 {
    state.clear();
}

// Time-based expiration
if !state.contains("cleanup_time") {
    state["cleanup_time"] = now();
}
if (now() - state["cleanup_time"]).as_secs() > 3600 {
    // Remove old entries
    for key in state.keys() {
        if should_expire(state[key]) {
            state.remove(key);
        }
    }
    state["cleanup_time"] = now();
}
```

**Sequential processing**: State requires sequential mode, which processes one event at a time. For large files (100M+ events), consider:

- Using `track_*()` functions with `--parallel` when possible
- Filtering before stateful processing to reduce volume
- Breaking into smaller files for distributed processing

#### Debugging State

Inspect state at any point:

```bash
# Print state size periodically
kelora -j logs.json \
  --exec 'state["count"] = (state["count"] ?? 0) + 1;
           if state["count"] % 1000 == 0 {
             eprint("State size: " + state.len() + " keys");
           }'

# Dump final state as JSON
kelora -j logs.json \
  --exec 'state[e.user] = true' \
  --end 'print(state.to_map().to_json())' -q > state_dump.json

# Check state contents in --end stage
kelora -j logs.json \
  --exec 'state[e.level] = (state.get(e.level) ?? 0) + 1' \
  --end 'eprint("Final state: " + state.to_map().to_kv())'
```

#### Parallel Mode Restriction

Accessing `state` in `--parallel` mode causes a runtime panic with a clear error message. State requires sequential processing to maintain consistency:

```bash
# This will fail:
kelora -j logs.jsonl --parallel \
  --exec 'state["count"] += 1'
# Error: 'state' is not available in --parallel mode
```

For parallel-safe tracking, use `track_*()` functions instead.

#### Example Use Cases

**Deduplication - track seen IDs:**
```rhai
if !state.contains(e.request_id) {
    state[e.request_id] = true;
    // Process first occurrence
} else {
    // Skip duplicate
    e = ();
}
```

**Store complex nested state:**
```rhai
if !state.contains(e.user) {
    state[e.user] = #{login_count: 0, last_seen: (), errors: []};
}
let user_data = state[e.user];
user_data.login_count += 1;
user_data.last_seen = e.timestamp;
if e.has("error") {
    user_data.errors.push(e.error);
}
state[e.user] = user_data;
```

**State machines for protocol analysis:**
```rhai
if !state.contains(e.conn_id) {
    state[e.conn_id] = "NEW";
}
let current_state = state[e.conn_id];

// State transitions
if current_state == "NEW" && e.event == "SYN" {
    state[e.conn_id] = "SYN_SENT";
} else if current_state == "SYN_SENT" && e.event == "SYN_ACK" {
    state[e.conn_id] = "ESTABLISHED";
} else {
    e.protocol_error = true;  // Invalid transition
}
e.connection_state = state[e.conn_id];
```

## Span Hooks (`--span-close`)

### `span`
- Type: `Span` (custom Rhai type)
- Binding available only in `--span-close`. Read-only.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `span.id` | `String` | Unique span identifier (`#0`, `#1`, ... for count spans; `2024-01-15T10:00:00Z/5m` for time spans). |
| `span.start` / `span.end` | `DateTime` or `()` | Span boundary timestamps (time spans only). |
| `span.size` | `Int` | Number of events that survived filters and entered the span. |
| `span.events` | `Array<Map>` | Copy of each included event, with helper fields (`line`, `line_num`, `filename`, `span_status`, `span_id`, `span_start`, `span_end`). Read-only. |
| `span.metrics` | `Map` | Per-span deltas computed from `track_*()` calls since the span opened; zero-delta keys are omitted. Read-only.

> `--span-close` runs without a "current event", so `e` and `meta` are empty. Inspect `span.events` when you need per-event details from inside the close hook.

### `metrics` vs `span.metrics`
- `span.metrics`: Only the delta accumulated while the span was open. After the hook runs, Kelora resets the baseline for the next span; mutations are discarded. Read-only.
- `metrics`: The global tracker map used across the entire run (the same map exposed to `--end`). Values persist between spans and reflect cumulative totals; update via `track_*()` calls, not direct assignment. Read-only.

## Windowed Scripts

- `window`: Present when using `--window` features. It is an array of event maps representing the sliding window, with `window[0]` being the current event followed by prior events retained by the window manager. Read-only.

## Begin / End Hooks

- `--begin`: Runs before any event is parsed. `e` and `meta` start empty; use this stage for initialization and configuration population (`conf`).
- `--end`: Receives the final `metrics` map so you can report overall totals after processing completes.
