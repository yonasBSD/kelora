# Kelora

**Scriptable log processor for the command line.**

Parse messy logs into structured events, then filter, transform, and analyze them with embedded [Rhai](https://rhai.rs) scripting.

!!! note "Development Status"
    Kelora is a working log analysis tool validated by 770+ automated tests and cargo-audit/deny, and it has held up in months of real use. It is also an experiment in agentic AI development: both code and tests are generated by Claude Code and GPT-5 Codex for a Rust beginner, without manual review. Use appropriate judgment for your environment, review the code if you need production assurances, and expect breaking changes before 1.0. See the [Security Policy](https://github.com/dloss/kelora/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for details.

*Filtering noisy logs, parsing custom formats, and visualizing log levels*

## What It Does

Parse any log format, filter with expressions, transform with 100+ functions, track metrics, analyze in context with sliding windows.

**Parse custom formats and extract structured data** - No regex wrestling:

=== "Command/Output"

    ```bash exec="on" source="above" result="ansi"
    kelora -f 'cols:ts level service request_id *message' examples/release_pipe.log \
      --cols-sep '|' \
      --levels warn,error \
      --exec 'e.merge(e.message.parse_kv())' \
      -F json
    ```

=== "Log Data"

    ```bash exec="on" result="ansi"
    cat examples/release_pipe.log
    ```

**Enrich events with recent context** - Add error context from sliding window:

=== "Command/Output"

    ```bash exec="on" source="above" result="ansi"
    kelora -j examples/api_errors.jsonl \
      --window 5 \
      --exec 'let err = window.filter(|x| x.level == "ERROR");
              if err.len() > 0 { e.ctx = err[0].error; }' \
      --keys timestamp,endpoint,ctx \
      -F logfmt
    ```

=== "Log Data"

    ```bash exec="on" result="ansi"
    cat examples/api_errors.jsonl
    ```

## Works Well With

Kelora thrives in command-line pipelines. Stream logs from kubectl, tail, or journalctl into Kelora, then pipe output to jq, SQLite, qsv, or visualization tools. See [Integrate Kelora with External Tools](how-to/integrate-external-tools.md) for 18 tools and usage patterns.
